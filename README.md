Through the Earth
=================
A website that tells you where you would land if you fell through the Earth. 

Background
----------
The idea for this project was inspired by a map/geography enthusiast who introduced the author to the geographical term, "antipode." The Oxford Dictionary defines antipode as "the direct opposite of something," or in this case, two locations that are exactly opposite of each other on the Earth.

Summary
-------
- At the home screen, the user is prompted to enter their location 
- Once the 'Fall' button is pressed, a map appears with markers that indicate the user's location and their antipode 
- Below the map, the user is told where they have landed, what the weather is like there, and recent news articles related to their new location 
- Users can interact with the links on the page or start a new search by scrolling up to the top of the page or by hitting the 'Top' button located on the bottom-right side of the page
